Vgg_16_bn: Used pre-trained model and only trained the classifier. In self.classifier included own linear layers of size (512*12*15,2048),(2048,1024),(1024,339). Did not use adaptive avg pooling
Trained and tested this model for 100 epochs first. First trained this model for 100 epochs. the results were being saved only for the best epoch. The best val_acc was 98.7 and the bets epoch was 93.
The result wre saved in the folder "vgg_results". Felt that we could be overfitting when looked at the loss and accracy plot. So decided to train a little less till 70 epochs. Next trained the model
for 70 epochs. Unfortunately did not save the model for every 5 epochs. Again the best Val acc was 95.1 and the best epoch was 68. The result wre saved in the folder "vgg_results_70epchs".
But still feel that we should train it little more less. Will try to train it till 50 epochs.

ResNet18 and ResNet 50: Used pre-trained, only trained mode.fc. Tried including multiple linear layers in miodel.fc similar to vgg_16_bn above. Tried (2048,1024),(1024,512),(512,339), but did not help the training was really slow even after 40 epochs the val acc was only 2%.
Tried using pretrained model and only changing the number of classes in the linear layer as shown in "https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html". However, the network was learning but very slow learning, we could reach only 30% after 60 epoochs.
So, deleted all these results folders.

Squeezenet_1_0: Training squeezenet1_0 by just changing the classification layer number of classes to 339 as in the above link from resnet. Training it for 80 epochs.
The result wre saved in the folder "Classification_Results/squeezenet_results_80_epochs". Best val_acc was 74.11 for 80th epoch.

Again trained above squeezenet for 100 epochs. Best Value_acc  was 81.1 for 98th epoch. The result wre saved in the folder "Classification_Results/squeezenet_results_100_epochs"

In all the above runs the learning rate was constant at 0.001

Now, fixed that issue and ran the Squeezenet_1_0 for 150 epochs with exponential LR decay of 0.1 every 50 epochs.
